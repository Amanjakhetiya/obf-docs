# Draft proposal for OBF affiliated projects 

## Background

The Open Bioinformatics Foundation or O|B|F (OBF) is a non-profit, volunteer-run
group dedicated to promoting the practice and philosophy of Open Source
software development and Open Science within the biological research community.

Main activities are:

* Running and supporting the BOSC conferences.
* Organizing and supporting developer-centric "Hackathon" events.
* Participating in the Google Summer of Code program on behalf of our member projects as an umbrella mentoring organization.
* Managing servers, colocation facilities, bank account, domain names, and other assets for the benefit of our member projects.
* Public opinion and policy statements about matters related to Open Source and Open Science in bioinformatics. 

The Foundation does not participate directly in the development or structure of
the open source work, but as the members of the foundation are drawn from 
project developer communities, there is clear commonality of direction and
purpose.

O|B|F grew out of the volunteer projects BioPerl, BioJava and Biopython. Later
BioRuby, BioSQL, BioLib, DAS, MOBY, EMBOSS, and OBDA were added as 'main
projects'.  There is now also a host of listed 'affiliated projects', 'related
projects', and 'ontologies and definitions'.

## Motivation

Affiliating an open source software project with OBF has value for both the
project and the OBF. For the project it raises its profile and may increase its
public standing, and thereby attract more attention. For the OBF it is driving
the primary objective of supporting open source projects in bioinformatics. Also 
affiliated projects bring volunteers to the OBF effort.

At this point the ranking of projects under the different headers is arbitrary.
Not all projects are equal in terms of their activity, community, audience, and
wider impact on bioinformatics and the list of main and affiliated projects
does not necessarily reflect that. Also, over time, projects change, become
less relevant and even die. This proposal aims to formalize the choice and
level of affiliation of software development projects in relation to the OBF.

For this the commission proposes a democratic promote/demote procedure that
allows for adjustment of project status. This does not mean that all projects
are discussed every year.  In fact, the idea is to have little change and
champion the status quo. Even so, the first years we may see to the most
adjustments.

## Procedure

This commission proposes that projects should be selected by virtue, using a
number of OSS countable measures. Annually the BOSC participants can vote to
change the affiliation of a project. Even so, the OBF board can still veto a
change in a board meeting.

## Project status requirements

The existing project status for OBF projects is 'main project', 'affiliated
projects', 'related projects', and 'ontologies and definitions', we would like
to add 'new projects' and 'student projects' and rename 'related project' to
'interesting project'. Here we explain each status:

### Main project (vote)

Main OBF projects are long standing OSS initiatives with an active developer
community and a largisch bioinformatics user base. These projects are known for
their great attitude to new comers, are active members of the OBF and have a
great web presence. Long standing examples are BioPerl and Biopython.

### Affiliated project (vote)

Affiliated OBF projects are active OSS initiatives for bioinformatics with an
active developer community. These projects are narrower in focus and may have a
smaller user base. Key is that the voters think the project highly relevant and
that their developers and community are very active and are active members of
the OBF.

### Ontologies and definition affiliated project (vote)

Same requirements as an affiliated project, with a focus on data analysis and
standards, rather than on developing software.

### New project (vote)

A project can be a 'new project' for one year. New projects have the promise to
develop themselves into an affiliated project.

### Student project (no vote)

Any student project executed under the wing of OBF is listed. These projects are not voted on.

### Interesting project (no vote)

An interesting project is any project that is active and is of interest to the 
wider bioinformatics community. These projects are not voted on. The list is 
maintained by OBF members and references on the OBF website should be little
more than link outs (a URL with a short description). There is no obvious
affiliation between OBF and such projects.
 
## Preparation and voting

Annually, ahead of BOSC, two people volunteer to prepare the round of project
status selection. Their job consists of:

* Providing project metrics of activity and impact for all existing and candidate main and affiliated projects
* Short list projects that may want a status change
* Ask these projects for feedback
* Announce plans for voting and ask for OBF community feedback over the ML
* Prepare a final voting list and expose it online at least 14 days before BOSC

During BOSC

* Announce the motivation for changing a project status
* Present metrics and justification
* Allow a project a 5 minute presentation to defend their point of view (if required)
* Organise and execute the voting

While this activity may suggest a high level of project status dynamics, the
aim is to actually change as little as possible. Only when a project status
change is obvious and warranted, it should be brought forward and presented at
BOSC. Meanwhile, it is interested to see what metrics are available annually for
all OBF projects.

## Voting at BOSC

Voting happens based on the short list presented that has been prepared
beforehand and published.  Ad hoc voting is not possible. When people want
unprepared changes, they need to prepare that for the next BOSC. In extreme
cases, i.e. when a project does not live up to OBF standards, the OBF board may
interfere during the course of the year.

### Main project (promote or demote)

To become a main project a project has to be an affiliated project for at least
3 years. At BOSC attendees can vote an affiliated project into a main project.
In rare cases a main project can be voted out of the list. In both cases the a
majority of 70% is required, and the OBF board can still veto the outcome.

### Affiliated project (promote or demote)

To become an affiliated project a project has to have interesting, new or
student project status for at least 1 year. At BOSC, attendees can vote such a
project into an affiliated project.  Also an affiliated project can be voted
out of the list. In both cases the a majority of 70% is required. The OBF
board can still veto the outcome.

### New project (promote)

A new project has special status for one year.  At BOSC attendees can vote a
project into an affiliated project. A majority of 70% is required, and the OBF
board can still veto the outcome.

### Other

Other project status (changes) are not voted on, but simply maintained on the
wiki. Any dispute on what belongs there or not has to be diverted to the OBF,
as it is an OBF website.

## Finally

At this point the commission favours a hand vote at BOSC of all attendees. If
this proves unpractical for whatever reason, we could change to a 24 hour
online voting during the conference. The latter may have the advantage that all
OBF members can vote, even when not attending BOSC.
