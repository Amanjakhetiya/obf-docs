# OBF Affiliated Project Status Policy (Unratified Draft) 

_Status: This policy is currently being developed. It has not been discussed beyond the Board of Directors yet._

## Background

The Open Bioinformatics Foundation (O|B|F) is a non-profit, volunteer-run
group dedicated to promoting the practice and philosophy of Open Source
software development and Open Science within the biological research community.

O|B|F originally grew out of the volunteer projects BioPerl, BioJava
and Biopython. Later BioRuby, BioSQL, BioLib, DAS, MOBY, EMBOSS, and
OBDA joined the OBF umbrella, primarily as a consequence of requiring
project hosting support, existing community relationships, and through
informal consensus among members of O|B|F's Board of Directors. O|B|F
has since become hesitant to include new projects under the official
umbrella, in part because the growth in O|B|F-hosted project resources
has reached the capacity of O|B|F servers, and in part because of
O|B|F's mission and scope as an organization. Furthermore, the
[existing listing of projects related to O|B|F](http://www.open-bio.org/w/index.php?title=Projects&oldid=4609)
in different ways uses affiliation categories that are based neither
on a formal definition nor on a community process for attaining them,
and are thus poorly aligned with O|B|F values of community and
transparency.

## Motivation

This policy aims to formalize criteria and a community-driven,
transparent process by which open-source software projects can gain,
lose, and maintain certain types of affiliation with the O|B|F.

Establishing an affiliation between an open source software project and O|B|F has value for both the
project and the O|B|F. It can raise a project's profile and public standing, which in turn can allow it to attract more attention from users as well as potential volunteers, and can thus promote a project's overall health. Promoting the health and sustainability of bioinformatics open-source software projects is among
the O|B|F's primary objectives. In addition, 
the user and developer communities of affiliated projects constitute the primary pool of volunteers for O|B|F as an organization and an umbrella effort.

That notwithstanding, the O|B|F has not, and does not intend to serve
primarily as a project hosting provider for bioinformatics open-source
projects. Instead, as a project umbrella the O|B|F's focus is on
projects that serve, or have the potential to serve, a large variety
of bioinformatics research applications and users. Therefore, the
group of projects with some status of affiliation with the O|B|F is
expected to always be limited in number. In keeping with the potential benefits of affiliation for a project, the criteria formalized here aim to maintain O|B|F's historical focus.

Projects differ in terms of their activity, community, audience, and
wider impact on bioinformatics. Also, over time, projects change, become
more active, or less relevant and even dormant. This policy aims to provide mechanisms through which projects' affiliations can reflect such dynamics.

## Procedure

This commission proposes that projects should be selected by virtue, using a
number of OSS countable measures. Annually the BOSC participants can vote to
change the affiliation of a project. Even so, the OBF board can still veto a
change in a board meeting.

## Project status requirements

The existing project status for OBF projects is 'main project', 'affiliated
projects', 'related projects', and 'ontologies and definitions', we would like
to add 'new projects' and 'student projects' and rename 'related project' to
'interesting project'. Here we explain each status:

### Main project (vote)

Main OBF projects are long standing OSS initiatives with an active developer
community and a largisch bioinformatics user base. These projects are known for
their great attitude to new comers, are active members of the OBF and have a
great web presence. Long standing examples are BioPerl and Biopython.

### Affiliated project (vote)

Affiliated OBF projects are active OSS initiatives for bioinformatics with an
active developer community. These projects are narrower in focus and may have a
smaller user base. Key is that the voters think the project highly relevant and
that their developers and community are very active and are active members of
the OBF.

### New project (vote)

A project can be a 'new project' for one year. New projects have the promise to
develop themselves into an affiliated project.

### Other projects

Projects other than those under the stated affiliation categories may
have a de-facto relationship with O|B|F or one of its official member
projects, but they do not have a recognized affiliation status. As
such, their status is also not voted on.

These projects may include student projects with O|B|F community
participation, including projects executed under the O|B|F umbrella,
and other projects considered active and interesting to the wider
bioinformatics community. They may be listed and described on the
O|B|F wiki so long as it is evident that they do not have an official
affiliation with the O|B|F as per the ones defined here.
 
## Preparation and voting

Annually, ahead of BOSC, two people volunteer to prepare the round of project
status selection. Their job consists of:

* Providing project metrics of activity and impact for all existing and candidate main and affiliated projects
* Short list projects that may want a status change
* Ask these projects for feedback
* Announce plans for voting and ask for OBF community feedback over the ML
* Prepare a final voting list and expose it online at least 14 days before BOSC

During BOSC

* Announce the motivation for changing a project status
* Present metrics and justification
* Allow a project a 5 minute presentation to defend their point of view (if required)
* Organise and execute the voting

While this activity may suggest a high level of project status dynamics, the
aim is to actually change as little as possible. Only when a project status
change is obvious and warranted, it should be brought forward and presented at
BOSC. Meanwhile, it is interested to see what metrics are available annually for
all OBF projects.

## Voting at BOSC

Voting is based on the short list prepared and published in advance.  Ad hoc voting is not possible.

### Main project (promote or demote)

To become a main project a project has to be an affiliated project for at least
3 years. At BOSC attendees can vote an affiliated project into a main project.
In rare cases a main project can be voted out of the list. In both cases the a
majority of 70% is required, and the OBF board can still veto the outcome.

### Affiliated project (promote or demote)

To become an affiliated project a project has to have interesting, new or
student project status for at least 1 year. At BOSC, attendees can vote such a
project into an affiliated project.  Also an affiliated project can be voted
out of the list. In both cases the a majority of 70% is required. The OBF
board can still veto the outcome.

### New project (promote)

A new project has special status for one year.  At BOSC attendees can vote a
project into an affiliated project. A majority of 70% is required, and the OBF
board can still veto the outcome.

## Maintenance of affiliation status

The affiliation status of a project that is not voted on remains the same for another year.

## Dispute and Board Veto

Any dispute on votes or current affiliation status of a project must
be brought before the O|B|F Board of Directors, who will arbitrate, if
necessary by public meeting and vote. The Board's decision is final
and binding.

The O|B|F Board of Directors may, at its discretion, veto, instate, or
terminate a project's official affiliation status, if the Board feels
the need to do so. It is expected that the Board will do so in public
session, whether at an annual Board meeting, or at a specifically
convened one.
